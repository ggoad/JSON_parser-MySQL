!DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!

Creating this was stupid. MySQL has a standard JSON data type. Use that.

BUT :: I can say I've written a JSON parser in MySQL functions and procedures... Here it is.

This was written many, many years ago. It never entered extensive use, so I'm sure there are bugs.

This is a library to act as a JSON parser, so functions and procedures can accept JSON arguments and parse them internally.
